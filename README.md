# eufy_robovac_mqtt
Controls a eufy robovac via MQTT

Uses https://github.com/mitchellrj/eufy_robovac library to connect to the robovac.  There is an excellent description on how to get the localKey and devId at https://github.com/apexad/eufy-robovac.  Just make sure you use the correct version of the Eufy app.

WIP: Alpha stage.  Connects to my Robovac30c and publishes state to broker.
